# YOLO corner detector

This repo is a fork of [`ultralytics/ultralytics`](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) with some modifications 
to train a corner detection model. The implementation is made on top of _YOLOv8-pose_ so that the keypoints correspond 
to the corners of the bounding boxes.
